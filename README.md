# generator-node-kata

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

Hey there, 

Thanks for checking out my node code kata generator, yo can install it with Yeoman or fork the base repo which can be found [here](https://github.com/james-dowell/node-kata-base-project)

####Roadmap
 - Include babel (for ES6+ compatability)


I will be compiling a list of Kata's that I have done using this project and you can check it out [here](http://jamesdowell.me)

### Usage

To run the tests without watching the files (single run) use the following gulp command:
```
gulp test
```

To run the tests and watch the files use the following gulp command:
```
gulp test:auto
```

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-node-kata from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-node-kata
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo node-kata
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
