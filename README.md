# generator-node-kata

## Getting Started

Hey there,

Thanks for checking out my node code kata generator, you can install it with Yeoman or fork the base repo which can be found [here](https://github.com/james-dowell/node-kata-base-project)

### Usage

To install generator-node-kata from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-node-kata
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo node-kata
```

To run the tests without watching the files (single run) use the following gulp command:
```
gulp test
```

To run the tests and watch the files use the following gulp command:
```
gulp test:auto
```

####Roadmap
 - **0.0.3** Include babel (for ES6+ compatability)


### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-node-kata from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-node-kata
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo node-kata
```
